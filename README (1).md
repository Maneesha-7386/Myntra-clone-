## Overall Learning 

> _This is a placeholder. Replace the text below with your personal learning summary._
During my internship at Sure Trust, I learned how to build responsive web pages using HTML and CSS, add interactivity with JavaScript, and develop component-based applications using React. I understood how to manage data using JSON, handle application state, and work with real-time project structures. I also learned how to debug issues, follow proper folder structures, and deploy projects using tools like GitHub and Netlify.

</div>

<!-- Project 1 -->
<h3 id="project1">Project 1:E-Commerce Website(Myntra.com)Clone</h3>
<p>
 Myntra Clone – Frontend E-commerce Project:
I designed and developed this single-page application (SPA) to practice building scalable React modules and to understand the working of a real-world fashion e-commerce platform like Myntra. The project demonstrates the core functionality of the Myntra website.

Key implementations include:

Redux Toolkit for managing global state such as Cart, Wishlist, and Orders.

React Router for seamless navigation between browsing products, product listings, and checkout flow.

Responsive UI design to ensure the application works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

API integration for fetching dynamic product data and applying filters similar to the real Myntra platform.
